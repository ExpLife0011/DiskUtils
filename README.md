# DiskUtils
DiskUtils is a lightweight command-line tool for operating on drives. The tool currently contains the following features:
* Erasing of an existing drive. This feature overwrites the selected drive with junk data.
* Dumping of an existing drive. This feature reads all the raw contents of a drive and writes them to a dump file.
* Writing of an existing drive. This feature writes a raw disk image file to the selected drive.

TODO: doxygen documentation and cleaning up of the code.
